                <div class="inner-image-container"><img src="../images/abyssinian2.webp" alt="Abyssinian cat"></div>

                <p> The Abyssinian is a breed of cat with a distinctive "ticked" tabby coat, in which individual hairs
                    are banded with different colours. They are also known simply as Abys.
                    The first members of the breed to be exhibited in England were brought there from Abyssinia (now
                    known as Ethiopia), hence the name. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinian_cat"

                <p> Aegean cats are a naturally occurring landrace of
                    domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece and western Turkey. It is considered a
                    natural cat, developing without human interference. But the variety has yet to be recognized by any
                    major fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat.

                <p> The Himalayan (short for Himalayan Persian, or Colourpoint Persian as it is commonly referred to in
                    Europe), is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired cat similar in type to the Persian, with the
                    exception of its blue eyes and its point colouration, which were derived from crossing the Persian
                    with the Siamese. Some registries may classify the Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed of Siamese,
                    or a colourpoint sub-breed of Persian. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_cat"

                <div class="inner-image-container"><img src="../images/Persiann.jpg" alt="Abyssinian cat"></div>

                <p> The Persian cat, also known as the Persian Longhair or simply Persian, is a long-haired breed of cat
                    characterised by a round face and short muzzle. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might
                    have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, but this has not been proven.

                <p> The Tiffanie is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length.
                    The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian
                    Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was
                    developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a
                    Burmese. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffanie_cat" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>]</p>
